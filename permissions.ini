;;=============================================================================
;;
;; 	Roles :
;; 	--------
;;
;;  The following are roles.  Roles are basically just grouped permissions
;;  that allow you to easily assign a group of permissions to an action or
;;	record.
;;
;;  Guidelines for Roles:
;;  ---------------------
;;  Role names should be in all caps (to differentiate them from permissions),
;;  and cannot contain any commas or punctuation of any kind.
;;  You can "extend" another role with the "extends" keyword.  For example:
;;    [READ]
;;    view = 1
;;
;;    [EDIT]
;;    edit = 1
;;
;;    [READ AND EDIT extends READ, EDIT]
;;
;;  In the above example, we defined a READ role and an EDIT role.  Then we
;;  defined a "READ AND EDIT" role that extends READ and EDIT.  What this means
;;  is that the READ AND EDIT role contains all of the permissions contained
;;  in the READ permission and the EDIT permission, and allows other permissions
;;	to be added also.

[NO ACCESS]
	register=1


;;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; The READ ONLY role is allowed to view records and perform the show all
;; and find actions.  Basically, anything that doesn't require making changes
;; is allowed with the READ ONLY permission

[READ BASIC]
;; A role that allows reading through the web but not in other structured formats
;; like CSV, XML, RSS, or JSON
	view = 1

;;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; The EDIT role extends the READ ONLY role so that anyone who can edit can also
;; READ.  It is pretty far reaching, as it provides permissions to edit records,
;; and manipulate the records' relationship by adding new and existing records
;; to the relationship.

[EDIT BASIC extends READ BASIC]

;;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; The DELETE role extends the EDIT role but adds the ability to delete
;; records and related records also.  Notice that the EDIT permission allows
;; the removal of related records but not the deletion of the records.  This is
;; relevant with ONE TO MANY relationships in which a record can only be removed
;; if the related record is deleted.

[DELETE BASIC extends EDIT BASIC]

;; The EDIT AND DELETE role is basically an alias of the DELETE role.

[EDIT AND DELETE extends EDIT, DELETE]

;;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; The OWNER role is encapsulates the permissions that the owner of a record
;; should have.  It allows full access to the current record, but not necessarily
;; full access to the table.

[OWNER extends EDIT AND DELETE]
	navigate = 0
	new = 0
	delete found = 0


;;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; The REVIEWER role contains a subset of the EDIT role.  It basically just allows
;; editing of the record itself, but not adding or removing related records.

[REVIEWER extends READ ONLY]
	edit = 1
	translate = 1

;;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; The USER role allows for reading and adding new related records.  This would
;; be useful for users to be able to add comments to the comments relationship
;; but not be able to edit the record itself.
[USER extends READ ONLY]

;; The ADMIN role allows full acccess .. kind of like ALL
