 * This template basically serves as a rolodex card for a particular record.
 * It shows the record details in a two column table with the first half (roughly)
 * of the fields displayed in the left column, and the last half in the right 
 * column.
 * This is a much more compact view of a record than is displayed in the 
 * View tab.  It is intended to be used when attempting to preview a record
 * in list view.
