/**
 * @brief An interface for widget handlers.  This interface is not *real*.  It is
 * only used for documentation purposes to demonstrate the methods that can be 
 * implemented by widget handlers.
 *
 * A widget handler is used by Dataface_FormTool to define how widgets are built, 
 * how data is loaded into them and how data is retrieved from them.  All widgets
 * in Xataface are built on <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTML_QuickForm/redirected">HTML_QuickForm</a>
 * but it is the job of Dataface_FormTool to construct these widgets for the Xataface
 * application.
 *
 * Generally a widget handler will implement at least the buildWidget() method as this
 * defines how the widget is built.  Some of them will also define pushValue() and 
 * pullValue() methods which serve as transformers to move data from an underlying
 * Dataface_Record object to the widget and back.
 *
 * @section widgethandler_registration Registering Widget Handlers with the Form Tool
 *
 * Before a widget handler can be used it needs to be registered with Dataface_FormTool
 * so that it knows which widget type the handler should be used to render.
 *
 * @see Dataface_FormTool::registerWidgetHandler()
 *
 * @section widgethandler_custom_widgets Building Custom Widgets
 *
 * Building a custom widget requires two key parts:
 *
 * -# Create a widget handler.
 * -# Register the widget handler with the Dataface_FormTool object.
 *
 * The recommended approach for creating a new widget is to package it in a module.  This
 * gives you maximum flexibility to includej all of the files necessary for your widget
 * and make it portable.
 *
 * - See @ref module_developer_guide_widget For more a brief tutorial on developing a 
 * custom widget as a module.
