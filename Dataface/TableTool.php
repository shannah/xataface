 *  Created: Oct. 20, 2005
 *  Description:
 *  ------------
 *  
 *  A tool provide application level integration to Table objects.  This class allows the
 *  Table object to be decoupled from the rest of the Dataface package.  The Table class
 *  has no knowledge of the Application object and associated Tools.  This tool augments
 *  the capabilties of the Table object by opening access to the Application object and
 *  associated tools.
 *  
 *  The goal is to make the Table object as self contained as possible.  The Table object
 *  currently has access only to the Dataface_converters package and configuration information.
